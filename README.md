“the things we send” - Cara Kwon
Medium: Interactive Web Installation
Tools: HTML, CSS, Javascript
“the things we send” is an interactive experience about how art moves, how it drifts through space, systems, and people to connect and leave something behind. It explores the invisible routes of exchange, where meaning travels not just through words, but through how it’s delivered. Like a package that carries the warmth of its sender’s hands, the act of sending becomes part of the story itself.
The work unfolds within a simulated desktop, a familiar yet fragile digital landscape. Each icon becomes a vessel of communication: a note, a letter, a parcel, a postbox. Together, they form a small constellation of emotional correspondence. As users explore the interface, dragging, unlocking, and uncovering hidden files, they piece together fragments of a message that slowly reveals itself. The experience asks for curiosity, patience, and interpretation, it’s less about solving and more about feeling your way through.
I chose to build this piece in code because I see programming as a poetic medium. My passion has always been storytelling, and code lets me choreograph structure and emotion into one continuous language. As a creative technologist, I’m fascinated by how systems can express tenderness, and how interfaces, when designed with intention can hold a pulse.
This project began as a technical challenge: to code a desktop entirely from scratch. But as I built it, I realized it mirrored my own process of thinking, neat, layered, yet quietly emotional underneath. Each decision became a narrative choice: why this color, this movement, this pause. Every function carried its own rhythm, like a stanza.
My process started with sketching familiar tools of communication, letters, packages, postboxes, and imagining how they might exist in a digital world. I then storyboarded the sequence through code, designing moments that mimic anticipation and arrival. Each interaction is treated like a verse, slow, deliberate, unfolding with intention.
To me, both art and code depend on participation. Nothing happens unless the user engages, clicks, drags, or sends. That small act of interaction gives technology emotional gravity; it turns the viewer into a collaborator. The website becomes a living letter, passed from one pair of hands to another through motion and attention.
Creating
“the things we send”
allowed me to merge everything I love, writing, interface design, and digital storytelling. It reminded me that impact doesn’t always shout; sometimes it hums softly. Art can live in the quiet tension between movement and stillness, in pixels and pauses, and in the simple, deliberate act of sending something out into the world.
